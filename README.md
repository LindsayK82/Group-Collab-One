# Group One Collab 

## Description

<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn? -->

The team collaborated to discover a real world problem:

-As a user, I would like to select my astrological sign and find a playlist attached.

The developers found a free horoscope API for usage, and added the YouTube API to produce playlist links into the cards to be displayed when the user selects their zodiac.

<!-- ## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license) -->

## Installation

<!-- What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. -->

To access the project, you will need an active internet connection. Once on the site, a user clicks their astrological sign. Hovering over a zodiac button with your mouse will show the date ranges for the zodiac. On clicking on the zodiac, a playlist link displays on the page.

## Usage

<!-- Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax: -->

On opening the site, the user is presented with a dynamic page featuring buttons to click based on the selected zodiac sign:

![Site](./assets/Images/Site-SS.png)
 

Once a zodiac is clicked (in this case, Cancer), a playlist link is displayed, an image with some attributes of the sign, and the daily horoscope:

![Horoscope](./assets/Images/Site-SS-2.png)


## Credits

<!-- List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
